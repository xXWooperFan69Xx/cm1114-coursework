                    <h1>Story time!</h1>
                    <p>Following the rising popularity of Hatsune Miku, "Vippers" (Vip News Bulletin@2ch users) schemed a troll "new VOCALOID release" as an April Fool's joke. Sen (線) provided the rough sketch and Nobuyo Oyama, a spoof for Doraemon's former voice actress Nobuyo Oyama, provided the vocal. The Teto project continued after the troll campaign, and her vocal was recorded again for the use on UTAU, which vocal synthesis software was released two months earlier. UTAU and Teto were both unnoticed among VOCALOID composers at first, but during the last half of the year of her release several creators started composing songs for Teto, causing her fame to be established during the following year. The voice provider's name reading was then changed to Mayo Oyamano (小山乃 舞世 Oyamano Mayo) to avoid unnecessary confusion.

                        Teto was given official acceptance to piapro on April 1, 2010, and to Project DIVA on October 10, 2011.
                        
                        At one point, Teto was tested in the VOCALOID engine by Wataru Sasaki, but was scrapped due to not meeting expectations. In 2012, Tomohide Ogata from AH-Software Co. Ltd. came into contact with Mayo Oyamano, discussing the idea of turning Teto into a VOCALOID. However, the voice could not be reproduced in a satisfactory manner.
                        
                        Teto was announced to have a TALQu speech voicebank in July 2021, which later released on January 8, 2022.[8] She was also released as an AI voice database for Synthesizer V Studio on April 27, 2023.</p>
